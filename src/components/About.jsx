        Hello, I'm Prabhjyot  Singh a young 24 year-old 2D General artist, specialising in storyboard and Concept art. Born and raised in New Delhi, I have done my bachelor's in Fine Art from Chitkara school of art design, Chitkara University. My love for stories and beautiful things lead me to Art and from there  on I'm on a journey to create and explore as much as I can. 
        My love for traveling and curiosity for learning legends and  epics of different cultures has provided me with experiences that helps me better my work in ways that helps differentiate it. My strengths are my strong observation and my hobby of consume most of pop culture and movies pushing me to improve my own work
